Stach is a hairdresser booking mobile app using React Native for the Frontend and ExpressJS for the Backend.

It's a draft project resulting from a group work. Code is working but hasn't been factored and cleaned.

Getting Started

You can use this backend to try the frontend locally, you can get the frontend part on another of my github repository.

You will have to build your own database on MongoDB, you can use datas from the folder "stachBDDExport" and create a database named "stach" and import collections appointments, comments, shops and users.

Good coding and have fun !
